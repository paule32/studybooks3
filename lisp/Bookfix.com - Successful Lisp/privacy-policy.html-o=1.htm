Your browser software assembles the pieces and displays them as a single page. On the Associate Web site you were visiting, most of the content you saw was transmitted from server computers used by the site's operator. However, the placement you just clicked on was different--we sent it to you directly from Amazon.com.</p></li><li><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What is an Amazon.com Associate?</font></b><p>An Amazon Associate is a Web site owner who places links to the Amazon.com Web site on his or her site and earns referral fees through sales of Amazon.com products. (To find out more about the Amazon Associates program, click here.)  The Web site that displayed this link to you is an Amazon.com Associate.</p></li><li><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">What information about me does Amazon.com receive and retain through this link?</font></b><p>Your browser automatically sends any Amazon cookies on your computer to our server when you view this type of Amazon.com link on an Associate Web site.   (For more information about how Amazon uses cookies, see our <a href="tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#104" tppabs="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496">Privacy Notice</a>.)</p><p>Although we may use your Amazon.com cookie to determine whether you are a recognized Amazon visitor and to offer personalized content (such as product recommendations) and special offers, we do not keep or attempt to construct a record of the Web sites you visit.</p><p><br>Of course, if you choose to click through to the Amazon.com site, we, like most Web sites, will receive and store your clickstream to, through, and from our site. For more information about the automatic information we collect, please read our <a href="tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#104" tppabs="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496">Privacy Notice</a>.</p></li><li><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Does Amazon.com share with third parties any information this service collects about me?</font></b><p>No. No personal information we may collect about customers who view, click, or purchase through Associate links is shared with third parties, including Associates, except as described by the Privacy Notice governing the Amazon.com Web site.</p></li><li><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Are products listed on Amazon.com Associate Web sites through this linking service the same as the personalized recommendations I receive when visiting Amazon.com?</font></b><p>They can be. The products you see listed when visiting an Amazon Associate's site can be based on a variety of factors, such as that site's topics and sales history. We might also show you items based on your own personal purchase history at Amazon.com. The Associate Web site hosting this Amazon.com link does not have access to these "personalized" recommendations.</p></li></ol><center><font size="-1"><a href="tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#105" tppabs="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/508088">Conditions of Use</a> | <a href="tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#104" tppabs="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496">Privacy Notice</a> &copy; 1996-2005, Amazon.com, Inc.</font></center><br><hr noshade size="1"><center><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Use the Back button on your browser to return to the Web site that you came from.</font></b></center><hr noshade size="1"></body></html>
