<p>Frequently asked questions:</p>

<ol>

<li><a name="faq-1"></a><i>May I make a copy of the online version of Successful Lisp for my own use?</i><p>Yes,
you may make a copy this HTML version so long as your copy is offline.
You may not publish Successful Lisp on any network accessible to the
public, nor may you distribute offline copies in any form.</p></li>

<li><a name="faq-2"></a><i>Is Successful Lisp available in Postscript, PDF, or an archive
format such as tar, zip or sit?</i><p>No. I maintain the content in
the web form that you see here. Making an archival version would be
contrary to my preference of having readers link directly to my site
so as to always have access to the latest version of the text.</p></li>

<li><a name="faq-3"></a><i>Is Successful Lisp available in a printed or printable
format?</i><p>Yes! A print edition is available as of December 2004 (ISBN
3-937526-00-5).  The book contains numerous corrections and improved
typography and layout.  You can <a href="#order">order Successful Lisp from Amazon.com</a>,
or check with your local bookstore or other major online booksellers.</p></li>

<li><a name="faq-4"></a><i>I'm having difficulty running my Lisp system or writing a Lisp
program.  Can you help?</i><p>No. I don't have enough free time to
engage in conversations of this nature.  I suggest that you talk to
your Lisp vendor or solicit the help of the fine people who frequent
the <tt>comp.lang.lisp</tt> newsgroup.  Be aware that these people
take a dim view of students who ask for homework solutions unless the
student has made (and documented) an attempt to solve the
problem. Students will find that they receive a warmer welcome in
<tt>comp.lang.lisp</tt> if they ask a specific question related to
understanding a particular aspect of Lisp.</p></li>
